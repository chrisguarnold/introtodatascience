<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Your Weekly Routine</h2>
<p>In this class, we will expose you to core concepts prior to the <em>actual</em> class. Because all this exposure is taking place before we actually come together, this frees up large chunks of time during the class that we can now spend on activities where you typically need the most help, such as application of basic material and engaging in deeper discussions and creative work with it.</p>
<p>A year ago, all this would have been quite revolutionary. But now, 12 months into this pandemic, this approach will already feel much more intuitive to us. Let me show you how this class seeks to implement flipped learning in a rigorous way. I will introduce all of our activities one by one.</p>
<p>Your first stop in every week will be the dedicated module homepage . This site is a mixture between a website and a teaching book. It will walk you through the content of each week and you can find the most important content explained there in written. I will also embed videos where I explain core elements in videos. The website format is perfect for embedding R code that shows you how you can use this software to analyse data on your own. Last but not least, each week will have some readings that will reflect the core content of the respective week from yet another perspective.</p>
<p>The respective content of the week will be uploaded on Monday morning, latest. I expect that you work through that home page on your own and expose yourself to the new concepts and material that are presented within. In case you have questions, please do reach out to me: I will have dedicated office hours three times a week.</p>
<p>The core purpose of this element is knowledge acquisition. The website offers you to take your own pace and revisit the parts that you find most challenging as many times as you want and at the pace that you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>While the homepage is focusing on knowledge acquisition, or workshops on Tuesdays between 12:00 and 2:00 oâ€™clock will focus on skills development. Learning how to do data analysis requires practice. And practice means failing a lot and learning from the own mistakes. The workshops on Tuesdays are meant to serve as a place where we can jointly explore how to properly manage, analyse and visualise data.</p>
<p>The workshops will always cover the content of the past week, obviously, so please make sure that you come prepared. Hence workshops will run from week 2 until week 11, focussing on the content from the respective previous week. Over the course of these two hours, you will be working online in small groups. For each week, I will prepare a lab sheet that you will jointly solve. Do not worry in case you struggle: I will be always around to help.</p>
<p>Without participating in these workshops, the assignments will be really challenging. I strongly recommend you do not miss a single session.</p>
<p>We will have bi-weekly module cafes where you can discuss any additional questions that you might have. In addition, these module cafes will also serve to answer any question regarding the assignments.</p>
<p>We completely understand that coming to university, and especially under these circumstances, can be overwhelming, and that it can be difficult to get a grip of everything that you need to do. Hopefully, this document will in itself be of some help, but I will also stay in touch with you every week to make sure that you are on board and repeat where we are in the module. It is vital that you check your email regularly, since we will only communicate with you through your university email. Being on top of emails is something that you will encounter when you enter working life, so this is good practice!</p>
