Welcome to this module. In PL 9239 you will learn how to make the most of data. How can you handle and analyse data efficiently? How to communicate and visualise results? While everything we do here has of course a wider appeal, we will focus in particular on our area: How can we use data to study politics and international relations? I am really looking forward to teaching the module again in Spring of 2022. Data to Answer Your Questions Today, data are everywhere. Data are not only collected for scientific studies. Governments, companies and non-profit organisations are amassing and increasingly sharing data at an unprecedented level. Data on their own can actually be a bit boring. Few people might enjoy to just browse numbers. Everything changes, however, if we can use data to answer a question we are interested in. This is why we we will build the module around three scenarios. Scenario 1: The Data Report Whatever you actually want to do with data, the first step is always getting a good oversight over the data itself. You will have to open the data and describe its most characteristic features. Often, you want to communicate these results to other colleagues in a data report. And all of your work with the data is ideally documented in a transparent way so that others—or even your future self—can easily understand what you were doing. This first scenario might actually be quite typical for your first years at work. Scenario 2: Knowing It All By Knowing A Few For the second scenario, imagine you are working for an NGO that helps implement voting observation missions in fragile democracies. Even though you are partnering up with local civil society organisations, you cannot send election observers too all polling stations during a mission. Luckily, this is not strictly necessary: As long as you properly randomise the polling stations you want to observe, you can infer the real, countrywide numbers on the basis of just a few hundred few hundred observations. In this class, we will learn why this is working and how you can do inference yourself. Scenario 3: Did the New Policy Have an Effect? Finally, take another example: A new law introduced mandatory environmental protection for farm land. A year later, biologists measure that harmful substances in ground water are down by 20%. Was this the effect of the policy? Or was it maybe just a particularly rainy year that washed all pollutants away? Together we will learn how we can find answers by asking our data the right kind of questions. The module is particularly relevant if you are planning to undertake a dissertation, since it will help you find the right data and how to work with it. Data literacy is not only a really useful skill to have as a modern citizen, it is also really valuable when you are looking for a job. Your Weekly Data Workout In this module, we will expose you to core concepts prior to the actual class. This frees up large chunks of time during the class that we can spend on activities where you typically need the most help, such as application of basic material and engaging in deeper discussions and creative work with it. Two years ago, all this would have been quite revolutionary. But now, 24 months into the pandemic, all of this feels actually quite intuitive. Let me introduce all of our activities one by one. 1 Work Through This Homepage Your first port of call in every week will be the respective chapter in this module homepage. This site is a mixture between a website and a teaching book. It will walk you through the content of each week and you can find the most important content explained here. The website allows you to take your own pace and revisit the parts that you find most challenging as many times as you want and at the pace that you feel comfortable with. The respective content of the week will be uploaded on Monday morning, latest. I expect that you work through that home page on your own over the course of the week. In case you have questions, please reach out to me via email or book time in the office hour. We will also use the module cafe every second week for answering any of your questions. 2 Apply Your Knowledge in Our Workshops While the homepage is focusing on knowledge acquisition, our workshops on Tuesdays between 1pm-1.45pm and Friday 3pm-3.45pm will focus on skills development. Learning how to do data analysis requires practice. And practice means failing a lot and learning from the own mistakes. The workshops on Tuesdays are meant to serve as a place where we can jointly explore how to properly manage, analyse and visualise data. The workshops will always cover the content of the past week, e.g. in the workshop in week 2 we will be covering the content of the homepage from week 1. Please make sure that you come prepared. Workshops will run from week 1 until week 11. Over the course of these two workshop hours, you will be working online in small groups. For each week, I will prepare lab sheets that you will jointly solve. Do not worry in case you struggle: I will be always around to help. Without participating in these workshops, the assignments will be really challenging. I strongly recommend you do not miss a single session. 3 Bring Your Questions to the Seminars We will have bi-weekly module cafes where you can discuss any additional questions that you might have. In addition, these module cafes will also serve to answer any question regarding the assignments. 4 Read Guideance on Planning and Structuring To guide you through all the hoops, I will also stay in touch with you with am email every Friday to make sure that you are on board. It is vital that you check your university email regularly, since we will only communicate with you through this address. The Module Webpage Let us take a closer look at how this website is working. This space is going to be the main learning tool for this term’s Introduction to Data Science for Politics and IR. Obviously, I will guide you through the material on this web-page via text. Think of it as a replacement for the lecture slides that you might find in other contexts: A place to find the core concepts and central ideas of this class. But not all is text. Sometimes, nothing beats someone actually explaining you core ideas. For that purpose, I will record small videos and embedd them here. The best thing about videos: You can watch them as many times as you want… Finally, this format is also really handy, because we will be able to take a look at R code. R is a computer language invented for data analysis, and you will learn how to use it in PL 9239. This is how it looks like when we will be covering R code. # All text in a line after the hashtag is a comment. # Here we assign some variables a &lt;- 1 b &lt;- 2 # This is how to add them and assign the result to another variable c &lt;- a+b # And finally we print the result cat(c) ## 3 Last but not least, each week will have some readings that will reflect the core content of the respective week from yet another perspective. I will add pointers to the readings whenever appropriate. You can find all information about the readings in the [bibliography]. Getting in Touch If you have questions or need any kind of help, feel free to get in touch. The whole purpose of our weekly workshops and our bi-weekly module cafe is to provide you with ample space for your questions. Make use of this! You can always drop me an email. I will respond at the end of the working day. You can also book time in my office hours Tuesday 3-4pm; Wednesday 3.15-4.15pm; Friday 5.15-6.15pm. "],["tools-for-working-with-data.html", "Chapter 1 Tools for Working with Data 1.1 What Is In a Data Spreadsheet? 1.2 Key Concepts 1.3 Meet: R 1.4 Readings for This Week", " Chapter 1 Tools for Working with Data This week we will get to know the basic tools we need. 1.1 What Is In a Data Spreadsheet? When we work with data, the first step is always to get an overview of the data—be it in academia, for a company or in government. The whole first part of this module is dedicated to teaching you how to understand your data in a quick and efficient way. We will learn a couple of important things. How to access data. How to get a quick overview over the data. How to describe data and extract their core characteristics. How to communicate and visualise results. How to manage everything efficiently. To give you an idea how and why even these basic skills matter in real life, I talked to Dr Sebastian Sternberg. He has a degree in politics and works as a data scientist with KPMG at the moment. In the interview, he was so kind to offer us insights into how he is working with data and how relevant data reports are in his daily work. 1.2 Key Concepts Let as begin with some key definitions. 1.2.1 What is a Statistic? Statistics summarise large amounts of numerical data. Statistics are really useful if one wants to get a good overview over data. A statistic is a characteristic of a sample. Imagine we make a number of observations and put in numbers what we see. When we calculate a statistic on this data, the statistic is able to describe the sample we collected. If we collect a different sample, the statistic is very likely to have slightly different values. The goal of statistical methods is to make inference about a population based on information from a sample of that population. Often, we might be interested in more than just the data at hand. By drawing a sample, we hope to generalise beyond our sample and learn something about the the overall population. For example, by asking a few hundred Welsh voters about their voting intentions we aim at saying something about the voting intention of all voters in Wales. To estimate parameters, we use statistical methods. Estimating a parameter means that you need to be able to say something about a certain parameter on the basis of a couple of data points that you collected. We will be learning how to use the correct statistics to infer what we believe is the most likely value for a certain parameter. In the voting example, we might be interested to understand what share of voters who would cast their vote for Plaid Cymru for example. Statistics can separate the probable from the possible. When we collect data, the data can have a range of different values. Of course, not all possible data points are equally likely. The beauty of statistics is that they can be used to tell us which values we can expect to see more often and which ones least often. For example, voters might be able to cast their vote for a whole range of parties—e.g. Labour, Conservatives, Plaid Cymru or the Welsh Nation Party. However, voting for these parties is not necessarily equally likely. It is reasonable to expect that, say, the Conservatives will receive more votes than the Welsh Nation Party. 1.2.2 Some More Definitions Some more definitions that a really useful for our module. It would not hurt if you could learn them by heart. Population: The full set of cases about which we want to generalise. Sample: A subset of the population. Variable: Logical set of attributes (characteristics) of an object (person, thing, etc.) that can vary across a range. Parameter: A characteristic of a population; usually unknown. Descriptive Statistics: Statistics that summarise the distribution of the values of variables in a sample. Inferential Statistics: The use of statistics to make inferences about a larger population based on data collected from a sample. 1.2.3 Types of Data Levels Example from our Survey Real World Example Measurement Possible Operations Nominal Tea or coffee? Gender, religion Categories Frequencies Ordinal Do you like summer? Social class, attitudes Categories and ranking Frequencies and ranking Interval How many hours do you study? Age, income All above and distance All above and addition and subtraction 1.2.4 Data in Action Remember that you were filling out the survey just before term? Overall, 23 of you responded (thanks!). Let us go and take a look at some examples of your data to better understand the different types of data that are out there. Nominal Data What do you prefer to drink in the morning? The variable encodes three different answer categories. These categories cannot be ranked, obviously. These are your responses: Ordinal Data How much do you like summer? You were given a scale that ranged from 1 to 5. The answers to this question can be ranked. However, it is not necessarily true that the distances between the answer categories is always the same. Now look at your responses: Here comes the sun! Interval Data Finally, let us consider some interval data. How many hours do you study per week? This data provides full hours. The data is discrete, its values can be ranked, and the distance between any two neighbouring categories is always the same. 1.3 Meet: R Now that we have a bit of an overview how data can look like, let us take a look at the main tool that we will use to manage, analyse and visualise data. We will use a programming language for this module that is called R. It is free and open source, so you can install it easily on your computers. It is also very powerful which means that all the effort that you are investing in these 10 weeks of the term to learn it will heavily pay-off when you are analysing data in the future—be it for research or in any other professional context. And ‘paying-off’ is meant quite literally here. R is a really valuable skill set to have on your CV and is certain to boost your employability quite a bit. If you want to know more about R, where its coming from and how it all developed, check the Wikipedia Page as a start. Also, feel free to go wild on the homepage of the R Project itself or in any other of your favourite corners of the internet. Beware: The rabbit hole is quite deep. #nerdalert 1.3.1 Install R Installing R is pretty straightforward: Go and visit the homepage of the The Comprehensive R Archive Network where you can find the latest version of R. At the top of the page, you can chose between your operating system: 1.3.2 Install R Studio Now that you have installed the programming language, let’s go and get a nice interface that actually helps us get our work down. R-Studio is a programme that makes it much more easy to write and execute R code. Go and get the free R-Studio desktop version. Install the version that suits your operating system. Nota bene: Make sure you first install R and then R-Studio. 1.3.3 How to Work with R Here is a quick video in which I show you around. You can also take a look at Chapter 2 in Fogarty (2019) for a lot of helpful details. 1.3.4 First Steps in R Now that you know how R-Studio looks like and how to use it, let’s go and try it out. As you saw, in the console tab you can run commands directly. But it is better practice to type them in an R script and send them. Every line of the text editor can be sent using Str + Enter in Windows and Cmd + Enter in MacOS. Objects R can keep several objects in memory at the same time. To distinguish them, object have names. Objects are assigned with an arrow like this: &lt;- Let us assign some values to objects. a &lt;- 5 b &lt;- 6 c &lt;- a * b Objects can be called using their name. Here on this homepage, you will see a second grey block that will give you the output. If you type all up in R Studio, you will find all R related output in the console. a ## [1] 5 b ## [1] 6 c ## [1] 30 We can combine several values with the function c(). Functions are really useful. There are basically three elements to a function. * First of call, they have a name—here in this case it is the letter c which stands for concatenate. * Then, functions always need one more more inputs. A function receives its inputs in the brackets (). * If you call a function and provide it with its correct inputs, it will do its thing and return the output that you asked for. a &lt;- c(1,2,3) a The object a is not a scalar any more. It is now a vector that has three elements to it, the numbers 1, 2 and 3. You can of course also assign more than just numbers. We can assign strings—here a couple of three digit country codes. cntry &lt;- c(&quot;BRA&quot;, &quot;GER&quot;, &quot;FRA&quot;, &quot;NLD&quot;) cntry ## [1] &quot;BRA&quot; &quot;GER&quot; &quot;FRA&quot; &quot;NLD&quot; If you want to see all the objects that we have in the workspace so far, try the function ls(). ls() ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;cntry&quot; &quot;dat21&quot; You want to remove an object? Then use the function rm() like so. rm(cntry) See, the object cntry is not in the workspace any more. ls() ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;dat21&quot; R Data Types In R, there can be different types of objects. Some can only take specific types of data. Scalar: numbers, characters, logical values Vector: sets of scalars Matrix: two-dimensional set of scalars of same type Data frame: Collections of vectors of (possibly) different types but with same length Let us begin from scratch with am empty workspace. To delete everything, we will nest two of the functions above. rm(list=ls()) First we assign some scalars. # scalar a &lt;- 43 b &lt;- a + 7 a ## [1] 43 b ## [1] 50 And here we go with some vectors. x &lt;- c(a,b,a,b) y &lt;- x + 10 cntry &lt;- c(&#39;Brasil&#39;, &#39;Canada&#39;, &#39;China&#39;, &#39;Singapore&#39;) x ## [1] 43 50 43 50 y ## [1] 53 60 53 60 cntry ## [1] &quot;Brasil&quot; &quot;Canada&quot; &quot;China&quot; &quot;Singapore&quot; Something interesting just happened here: You see the object x which is a vector? R added 10 to each of the scalars in x when calculating y. In programming you call this broadcasting. Pretty nifty! Next, we build a matrix, for example by binding two columns with the function cbind() or two rows with the function rbind(). z &lt;-cbind(x,y) z2 &lt;-rbind(x,y) z ## x y ## [1,] 43 53 ## [2,] 50 60 ## [3,] 43 53 ## [4,] 50 60 z2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## x 43 50 43 50 ## y 53 60 53 60 This is how a data frame looks like. It accepts vectors with any value. Data frames are quite similar to spreadsheets, for example in Excel or LibreOffice. dat1 &lt;- data.frame(cntry, z) dat1 ## cntry x y ## 1 Brasil 43 53 ## 2 Canada 50 60 ## 3 China 43 53 ## 4 Singapore 50 60 1.3.4.1 Selecting Elements Finally, we will learn how to select elements from objects. We will begin with vectors. a &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5) b &lt;- a + 10 We can select elements in R with [ ]. a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 a[2] ## [1] 2 a[2:4] ## [1] 2 3 4 Like in many other programming languages, the colon : expresses a range. Here we select all values in the range from the second to the fourth entry. We can also select elements from a matrix. The , helps to distinguish between the two dimensions. The selection m[1,1] will return the first element of the first column. In a similar vein, the selection m[3,2] will return the third element of the second column. m &lt;- cbind(a,b) m[1,1] ## a ## 1 m[3,2] ## b ## 13 Finally, we select elements from a data frame. We create a variable ‘name’ with the names of Mark, Luise and Peter. The variable ‘bike’ contains their bikes: Mountainbike, Single Speed and Racing Bike. We capture the hours per week they ride on it: 4, 7, 8 and finally we bring all variables together in a common data frame dat2. name &lt;- c(&#39;Mark&#39;, &#39;Luise&#39;, &#39;Peter&#39;) bike &lt;- c(&#39;Mountainbike&#39;, &#39;Single_Speed&#39;, &#39;Racing_Bike&#39;) hours &lt;- c(4,7,8) dat2 &lt;- data.frame(name, bike, hours) In data frames, you can select elements with the operator $ and the name of the variable dat2$bike ## [1] &quot;Mountainbike&quot; &quot;Single_Speed&quot; &quot;Racing_Bike&quot; You can of course still use the positions, too! dat2[,2] # gives you all entries for the second column ## [1] &quot;Mountainbike&quot; &quot;Single_Speed&quot; &quot;Racing_Bike&quot; dat2[1,2] # gives you the first entry for the second column ## [1] &quot;Mountainbike&quot; Since just selecting might not always be enough, R allows us to select elements based on conditions. R comes with everything formal logic requires. is equal == is not != smaller &lt; larger &gt; smaller equal &lt;= larger equal =&gt; You can build more complex queries via AND &amp; OR | Let’s go: x &lt;- c(1,56,23,89,-3,5) y &lt;- c(24,78,32,27,8,1) x[x &gt;20] # greater as 20 ## [1] 56 23 89 x[x &gt;20 &amp; x !=89] # greater as 20 and unequal 89 ## [1] 56 23 x[x&gt;0 | x==-3] # x where x greater 0 oder x=-3 ## [1] 1 56 23 89 -3 5 y[x==1] # y where x=1 ## [1] 24 1.4 Readings for This Week Please read chapter 2 and chapter 3 in (Fogarty 2019). This is where we end for this week. I am looking forward to meeting you in the workshops on Tuesday 1pm–1.45pm in Law 2.27 and Friday online on Zoom!
