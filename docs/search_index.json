Welcome to this module. In PL 9239 you will learn how to make the most of data. How can you handle and analyse data efficiently? How to communicate and visualise results? While everything we do here has of course a wider appeal, we will focus in particular on our area: How can we use data to study politics and international relations? I am really looking forward to teaching the module again in Spring of 2022. "]]
